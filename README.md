# Educational Retrieval-Augmented Generation Ontology

The Educational Retrieval-Augmented Generation Ontology (ERAGO) is a knowledge representation model for educational retrieval-augmented generation systems. It is designed to facilitate the development of educational retrieval-augmented generation systems by providing a structured representation of the domain knowledge.

## Directory Structure
- `vocab/`: Contains the vocabulary files.
- `ontology/`: Contains the detailed ontology files.
- `examples/`: Contains example files demonstrating how to use the ontology.(TODO)
- `docs/`: Contains documentation and specification files.(TODO)
- `resources/`: Contains useful resources for building this ontology.

## Getting Started
1. Review the vocabulary definitions in `vocab/`.
2. Explore the detailed ontology in `ontology/`.
3. Check out the examples in `examples/` to see how the ontology is applied.
